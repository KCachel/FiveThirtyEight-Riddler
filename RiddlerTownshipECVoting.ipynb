    "# Electoral College voting problem\n",

    ">Riddler Township is having its quadrennial presidential election. Each of the town’s 10 “shires” is allotted a certain number of electoral votes: two, plus one additional vote for every 10 citizens (rounded to the nearest 10).  \n",
    ">The names and populations of the 10 shires are summarized in the table below.\n",
    ">Which way will Riddler Township swing?\n",
    "!<img src=\"riddlertownship.png\" width = \"400\"/>)\n",
    ">As you may know, under this sort of electoral system, it is quite possible for a presidential candidate to lose the popular vote and still win the election.  \n",
    ">If there are two candidates running for president of Riddler Township, and every single citizen votes for one or the other, then what is the lowest percentage of the popular vote that a candidate can get while still winning the election?\n",
    "\n",
    "## How should we solve this?\n",
    "We will use integer optimization to solve the LP. In essence, we seek to minimize the popular vote while ensuring an electoral college victory. Since Riddler Township has a total of 75 electoral votes we know in order to win our candidate must have at least 38 electoral votes. Conveniently, each shire is a \"winner take all\" electoral shire (the majority popular vote candidate gets all the electoral votes).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given shire we define the following variables: \n",
    "\n",
    "*   `lose_ub` is the upper bound on the number of popular votes guaranteeing a loss in a given shire.\n",
    "*   `win_lb` is the lower bound on the number of popular votes guaranteeing a win in a given shire. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have an objective function and constraints emerging. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Formulating the Integer Linear Program\n",

    "$$\n",

    "*   (a.) **If our candidate wins the popular vote, then they get the electoral votes** or if $v_{i}$ $\\geq$ `win_lb`, then $x_{1} = 1$\n",

    "* (b.)  **If our candidate loses the popular vote, then they do not get the electoral votes** or if $v_{i}$ $\\leq$ `lose_ub`, then $x_{1} = 0$\n",

    "Both (a.) and (b.) are logic statements, and must be converted to constraints. (a.) is of the form if $a^Tx \\geq b$ then $z$ = $1$, which becomes $a^Tx - b \\leq Mz - (1-z)$ and (b.) is of the form if $a^Tx \\leq b$ then $z$ = $0$, which becomes $a^Tx - b \\geq m(1-z) + z$, where $M$ and $m$ are the upper and lower bound of $a^Tx-b$. \n",
